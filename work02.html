The description of this work is found on the following <a target="_blank" href="http://emanuelesantos.net/cursos/datavis/tarefas/tarefa-2/"> link</a>. In this page, I will show you two charts initially made in the Tableau. The data were exported with the own software (Tableau), saved in an excel file and after that manually inserted at the code javascript with <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/" target="_blank">highcharts</a>.
                 </p>

<b>First chart</b>, in this chart I tried answer the follow question: What are the top ten films that had higher worldwide gross. At this chart, I used a few configurations in <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/highcharts/highcharts_column_rotated.htm">this tutorial</a>.
